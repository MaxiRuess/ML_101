# ML_101
 
This Repo is designed to be a guide for different Machine Learning Models and Algorithms. 
All Models have a 
    - Notebook - Jupyter Notebook with Step-by-Step Instructions
    - Script - Python files to show how to deploy models 


The Repo starts of very simple with LinearRegression and progressivly gets more advanced. 
I'm trying explain the Algorithms as best as possible. Many of the text here have been written with help from ChatGPT. 

I've tried to make the code modular and unviersal applicable to other datasets. The only place where changes are required are in the YAML Config file. I've set it up this way so you can limit the specific what columns you want to include as features


##Current Models: 

### Regression 

- LinearRegression (OLS)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
